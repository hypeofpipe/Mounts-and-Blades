# Mounts and Blades

Would you like to play M&B (campaign) in multiplayer?

## Preface

I guess there's no sense to make this mod, if it is so difficult and no one'd notice it.

## Test-version

Test-version should be able to:
- connect players and show they movement on the map (as in singleplayer)

## Roadmap (so far):
- Make a test-version:
  - Investigate,
  - Find addresses,
  - Make tests
